    "Consider a tree-based model, when we divide the houses amongst many leaves, we also have fewer houses in each leaf. Leaves with very few houses will make predictions that are quite close to those homes' actual values, but they may make very unreliable predictions for new (unseen) data (because each prediction is based on only a few houses). Therefore, **overfitting** refers to a situation where a model matches the training data almost perfectly, but does poorly in validation and other new data. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if we make our tree very shallow, it doesn't divide up the houses into very distinct groups. When a model fails to capture important distinctions and patterns in the data, so it performs poorly even in training data, that is called **underfitting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we care about accuracy on new data, which we estimate from our validation data, we want to find the optimized point between underfitting and overfitting. Visually, we want the low point of the (red) validation curve in the figure below.\n",
